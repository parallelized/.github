# Parallelized

Parallelized is a code optimization competition organized by Varun Sahni for ShriTeq. Teams of two compete to achieve maximum speedup in Python within three hours.

## What is Parallelized?

It's a competition where teams optimize code to utilize hardware parallelism, aiming for the highest speedup multiple. Tasks are assigned with guidelines, and teams must complete them within the time limit.

### Why Parallelized?

In a world where Moore’s law is slowing down, optimizing code for speed is crucial. Parallelism techniques are essential, but Amdahl’s Law and code optimization challenges exist. Parallelized offers a 3-hour challenge to tackle these issues practically.

### Significance:

Optimizing code and leveraging parallelism are crucial in various fields like medicine and climate change research. Modern computers rely on parallelism, and code optimization improves performance and security. Learning these skills is vital despite challenges like Python’s GIL.

Parallelized provides a competitive platform for students to learn and apply these concepts effectively.
